# üóíÔ∏è Portfolio
Hello and welcome! I suppose you stumbled upon this. What's this you ask? Why my portfolio of couse!

# üìÅ Structure
- `pages/`: This is where all the pages go (in the format of Vue files)
  - `pages/index/`: Parent folder (used for quick navigation and hosts all pages)
  - `[...400].vue`/`[...500].vue`: Custom error pages for status codes 404 and 500.
  - `index.vue`: The main file which contains the OG card meta, the links and the `<NuxtChild>` element(s).
- `personal/`: This is where the config and it's types are stored.
- `public/`: This is where public/static assets are stored. Here the favicon is contained in both `.ico` and `.png` formats.
- `assets/`: This is where the website's statics are stored such as CSS.
  - `assets/css/`: This is where the website's CSS is stored.
  - `assets/css/tailwind.css`: This is where the Tailwind CSS file is stored.
  - `assets/css/csshake.css`: This is where styles from/for the `csshake` module are stored.
- `dist/`: This is where the pre-rendered build of the website is contained/stored.

# üì¶ Packages/Frameworks

  - Tailwind CSS Module ([`@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/tailwindcss))

# üîß Configurations
You can go to the config file (`personal/config.ts`) to configure some variables.
You'll find the config.ts file like this:
```ts
import Config from "./config.types.js";

export default <Config>{
    shake: false
}
```
Here you can edit the `shake` variable to enable or disable the shaking effect/animation.
